            "2. **Model Selection:**\n",

            "   - **Time Series Models:** If the data is time-dependent, consider models like ARIMA or VAR for capturing temporal dependencies.\n",
            "   - **Machine Learning Models:** For more complex patterns, use models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting. These models can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.\n",

            "4. **Integration of Additional Datasets:**\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Start with a thorough EDA to understand the distributions, correlations, and potential outliers in your data. This step will help in selecting the right model and features.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Model Selection:**\n",
            "   - **Linear Regression Models:** If the relationships between your variables are linear, starting with a simple linear regression can provide insights. However, planetary data often exhibits non-linear patterns.\n",
            "   - **Time Series Models:** If the data is time-dependent, consider models like ARIMA or VAR for capturing temporal dependencies.\n",
            "   - **Machine Learning Models:** For more complex patterns, use models like Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Gradient Boosting. These models can handle non-linear relationships and interactions between variables.\n",
            "   - **Neural Networks:** For highly complex data with potential non-linear interactions, neural networks can be powerful, especially if you have a large amount of data.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Model Evaluation:** Use cross-validation and performance metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or R-squared to assess your models. Make sure to split your data into training and test sets appropriately.\n",

            "4. **Integration of Additional Datasets:**\n",
            "   - Consider integrating datasets with variables like atmospheric conditions, solar activity, or historical planetary events. This broader context can enhance the model's accuracy and predictive power.\n",
            "   - Look for open-access celestial datasets that might provide supplementary information about planetary interactions and influences.\n",
